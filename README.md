# Advent of Code 2023 (Python)

This is my first time to participate in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzle challange.

My solutions are written in python on a jupyter notebook, to run them you'll need to have a basic jupyter notebook environment setup and ensure any dependencies are included from the `requirements.txt`. I am personally use the vscode jupyter extension.

Puzzle inputs are streamedlined with the use of the [advent of code data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) python library. Please follow the instructions on their repository to configure it with your own session id.
